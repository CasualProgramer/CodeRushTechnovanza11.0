# CodeRushTechnovanza11.0
This is made for Code Rush Technovanza 11.0

you have to download the source code and run index.html to run the project
note: 
  - There is no need to download the references folder, LogIn.html, SignUp.html and LogInDATA.json to run the project. They were used by us for trouble shooting, testing and make the UI
  - Though Log In and Sign Up system work they are currently using local storage due to time constraint
  - Log In and Sign Up system are currently meaning less as data does not change by logging in
  - Images in the references folder are the UI prototypes and concept of the the hole project made by us in canva
